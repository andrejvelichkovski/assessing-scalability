# Experiment description

Series of benchmark experiements will be performed with the end goal of assessing the scalability of lightweight virtualization systems. The key focus will be on Docker and Unikraft.

## Microbenchmarks

### Measuring boot time

#### Docker

Measuring the boot time of Docker image can be quite precisly estimated by starting a Docker container by timing the `docker start` command, or timing the Python Docker Dev API.

This analysis are already generated by the Docker Spawner CLI and can be used for further analysis

#### Unikraft

Measuring the boot time of Unikraft is slightly more complicated, as the Unikraft CLI tools don't provide a high level tool that returns once Unikraft boots. However, this benchmark is already performed by the Unikraft community in the Eurosys paper, and the plan is to adapt it and reuse it.

### Measuring memory and CPU usage

The simplest way of measuring memory usage is to observe the high level memory usage difference between running 0 and running 100 (or more general number X) instances.

## Macrobenchmarks

### Nginx benchmarks

### Redis benchmarks
